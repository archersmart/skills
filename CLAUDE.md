Skills are organized into bucket folders under `skills/`:

- `engineering/`: daily code work
- `productivity/`: daily non-code workflow tools
- `misc/`: kept around but rarely used, not promoted
- `in-progress/`: beta: public on purpose, feedback wanted, not shipped in the plugin
- `deprecated/`: no longer used

Every skill in `engineering/` or `productivity/` (the **promoted** buckets) must have a reference in the top-level `README.md` and an entry in `.claude-plugin/plugin.json`'s `skills` array (the Claude Code plugin ships exactly the promoted set). Skills in `misc/`, `in-progress/`, and `deprecated/` must not appear in either.

Install commands are copied verbatim from [.agents/install-block.md](./.agents/install-block.md). `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json` is the repo's own marketplace. Run `claude plugin validate . --strict` after touching either manifest. [ADR 0001](./.agents/adr/0001-ship-as-a-claude-code-plugin.md) records why the repo ships as a plugin.

Each skill entry in the top-level `README.md` must link the skill name to its `SKILL.md`.

Each bucket folder has a `README.md` that lists every skill in the bucket with a one-line description, with the skill name linked to its `SKILL.md`. The promoted buckets' `README.md`s and the top-level `README.md` group entries into **User-invoked** and **Model-invoked**; non-promoted bucket `README.md`s (`misc/`, `in-progress/`) use a flat list.

Skills in `engineering/` and `productivity/` also have a human-facing docs page at `docs/<bucket>/<skill-name>.md` (the docs tree mirrors those two bucket folders under `skills/`). When you add, rename, or change the behaviour of a skill in `engineering/` or `productivity/`, create or re-sync its docs page following [.agents/writing-docs.md](./.agents/writing-docs.md). A finished page carries four sections: **What it does**, **When to reach for it**, **Common questions**, and **It's working if**. Skills in the non-promoted buckets (`misc/`, `in-progress/`, `deprecated/`) get **no** docs page. The one exception is a promoted skill removed outright: its page stays, marked archived (see `writing-docs.md`).

Every `SKILL.md` is either user-invoked (`disable-model-invocation: true` plus `policy.allow_implicit_invocation: false` in `agents/openai.yaml`, reachable only by the human) or model-invoked (model- or user-reachable). See [.agents/invocation.md](./.agents/invocation.md).

To (re)link every skill outside `deprecated/` and `misc/` into the local harness skill directories (`~/.claude/skills`, `~/.agents/skills`), run `scripts/link-skills.sh`. Each entry is a symlink into this repo, so a `git pull` keeps installed skills current; re-run the script after adding, removing, or renaming a skill.

Releases run on changesets: `npm run changeset` records a pending change, and the Release workflow turns it into a "chore: version skills" PR. Merging that PR bumps `package.json` and `.claude-plugin/plugin.json` together (via `scripts/sync-plugin-version.mjs`) and tags the release, which is what makes plugin installs pick up the new version.

No em-dashes anywhere in this repo's prose (`SKILL.md` files, docs, `README.md`, `CHANGELOG.md`, ADRs, changesets, code comments). Where a sentence reaches for one, rewrite it instead with a comma, colon, period, parentheses, or a conjunction, whichever the sentence actually wants; never do a blind character substitution.
